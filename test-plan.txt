Pretty simple user interface:

1. make
2. ./input | ./pc
3. The program will then run infinitely until ctrl+c, which is handled by the program and executes fclose(stdin), immediately empties all queues to exit threads gracefulyl, and says 'Bye'. So on ctrl+c expect something like:


blue 9
	red 11
		green 13
blue 10
^C
STDIN CLOSED.
Clearing queue...

	red 13
		green 21
blue 12
	red 17
	red 19
	red 23
	red 29
	red 31
	red 37
	red 41
	red 43
	red 47
		green 34
blue 15
blue 18
blue 20
blue 21
blue 24
blue 25
blue 27
blue 30
blue 33
blue 35
blue 36
blue 39
blue 40
blue 42

Bye.
